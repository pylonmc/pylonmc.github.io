Join our Discord server to find out more.</p> <p>Pylon is split into two main parts: core and base. Pylon Core is a library which provides everything needed to make new content, while Pylon Base adds a bunch of new content. Pylon Core uses an addon system, much like Slimefun - in fact, Pylon Base is a Pylon addon. This means developers will be able to create their own addons and easily take advantage of Pylon's wealth of features.</p> <p>Watch this space!</p>"},{"location":"#discord","title":"Discord","text":"<p>https://discord.gg/4tMAnBAacW</p>"},{"location":"#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>https://pylonmc.github.io/</p>"},{"location":"configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"pylon-core/getting-started/","title":"Getting started","text":"<p><code>pylon-core</code> is written in Kotlin, a JVM language similar to Java, but with more modern features and concise syntax.
